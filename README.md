# 1911
On March 25, 1911, a deadliest industrial disaster happened in the Greenwich village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Fire erupted and caused the death of 146 garment workers, of which 123 were women and girls, and 23 were men. This incident is documented as Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire and is one of the deadliest in the US history. This incident is especially well known because of the fact that emergency protocols were not followed. The doors to the stairwells and exits were locked. People who could not escape jumped off from the high windows. Most of the victims were recent Italian and Jewish immigrant women and girls.  This is a virtual reality project that gives an immersive storytelling experience of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire incident from a first person perspective. Through this project we wanted the users to experience what it is like to be trapped in a fire accident. We used motion capture lab to capture body movements and rig them to a skeleton which was then setup in a unity scene for viewing in Virtual reality headset.
